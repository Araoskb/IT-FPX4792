            ARConnect is a new and experimental social media website for those who have had experience/served in the military, 
            have a passion for the military, or are in a Veteran status. When scrolling through other social media platforms 
            like Facebook, you see many people that reply to certain posts that do not specifically have a clue as to what 
            it is like to serve nor understand the "lingo" that many of us military folks pick up throughout our time in service.
            This platform aims to connect those who want to share experiences (fun or not) to others, whether for educational 
            or recreational purposes. ARConnect hopes to create bonds between individuals that can change their lives to 
            create the feel and sense of community not only across the United States, but the world.
